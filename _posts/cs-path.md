It all started at the National and [National and Kapodistrian University of Athens](https://www.di.uoa.gr/en) in 2020 when I began my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. From my first lab in C, I was inspired by one of the assistants, who was using a special editor to help me debug my code—[VIM](https://www.vim.org/). As soon as I returned home, I dedicated myself to understanding how it works, learning the keywords, and mastering it. To this day, VIM remains my primary editor. It may not have all the conveniences of modern IDEs, but it allows me to code quickly and with fewer distractions. After five years of writing C and C++ code with VIM, there’s no turning back.

As I progressed, I developed a deep passion for Data Structures and Algorithms. In my second semester, I started coding fundamental data structures from scratch, even though it wasn't required by the course. Driven by curiosity, I tackled the most challenging structures on my own. You can find some of my early implementations in the [algorithms-data-structures](https://github.com/PetropoulakisPanagiotis/algorithms-data-structures/tree/master) repository.

Over the following years, I dedicated significant effort to mastering C/C++, core software engineering concepts, Linear Algebra, and Discrete Structures. Our university's long coding exercises in C and C++ honed my understanding of the mechanics behind core data structures and algorithms.

As I neared the end of my degree, it was time to start my B.Sc. thesis. One day, I attended a presentation on Robotics in our department, despite being tired from a long day of lectures. That decision changed everything. The speaker, [Dr. Marios Xanthidis](https://www.sintef.no/en/all-employees/employee/marios.xanthidis/), inspired me deeply. He had completed his thesis at a different university, which was uncommon in Greece. After the presentation, I reached out to him and expressed my interest in robotics. This led to an introduction to his supervisor, Prof. Konstantinos J. Kyriakopoulos at the [National and Technical University of Athens (NTUA)](https://www.ntua.gr/en/). After an interview, he trusted me to start my thesis in his lab, the Control Systems Lab.

The journey through my B.Sc. thesis was challenging but rewarding. I discovered my passion for computer vision and deep learning and realized the potential of these fields in providing solutions to robotics problems. For the first time, I saw my algorithms taking real form, interacting with the 3D world through platforms like robots. I had no prior experience, but I learned quickly, diving into new fields such as Robotics, Kinematics, ROS, Visual Servoing, sensors like the Microsoft Kinect, and deep learning techniques like object detection and tracking.

Prof. Kyriakopoulos noticed my rapid progress, especially in deep learning. He trusted me to peer-review a paper for the 28th Mediterranean Conference on Control and Automation, which I eagerly accepted. The task was challenging, especially since the topic was heavy in mathematics, but I studied hard to provide a fair and impartial review.

After completing my thesis, which you can find here, [A Leader-Follower Mobile Robot Scheme using an RGB-D Camera and MobileNets](https://github.com/PetropoulakisPanagiotis/BSc_thesis), I developed a robotic system that uses an RGB-D camera and MobileNets for object detection, enabling a Leader-Follower scheme in mobile robots. The system was tested on Pioneer 3-AT and Summit-XL robots, showing high accuracy and efficiency, with a processing speed of 19 Hz on a GeForce GTX1060 GPU.

After receiving my Bachelor's degree, I wanted to deepen my knowledge in Computer Vision and Robotics. In 2021, I started my M.Sc. in Computer Science at the [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.cit.tum.de/cit/startseite/). My path during my M.Sc. was uncertain, but I embraced the unknown, believing that it offers great rewards when followed with instinct and courage.

During my studies, I focused heavily on lectures, which were theoretical and helped me deepen my understanding of state-of-the-art methodologies. In my second semester, I sought real-world experience and joined the DevOps team at the Institute of Flight System Dynamics. This experience helped me improve my skills in Docker, Git, and Python.

Later, I joined the Chair of Information-oriented Control at TUM and worked on the SeaClear project. This was one of the most interesting and challenging experiences of my academic career. I implemented a new MPC controller in C++ and Python, which was used to optimize a robot's performance in clearing seabed trash.

In the same semester, I participated in the practical course "Cloud-Based Robotics in Deep Reinforcement Learning," where my team performed exceptionally well. We extended our project into a research project and proposed a novel, task-specific autoencoder. You can find our complete work at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11984](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11984). This project was a rollercoaster, as it was our first research endeavor. 

The winter was particularly challenging, as I was also working as a student assistant while taking one of the most difficult courses in my master’s program, "Machine Learning," taught by [Prof. Stephan Günnemann](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/daml/team/damlguennemann/). Many students chose to skip it due to its difficulty, but I couldn't because of my passion for the subject. Despite advice to avoid taking multiple challenging courses simultaneously, I felt strongly about pursuing my interests. I took other courses, worked as a student assistant, and collaborated with Ludwig Gräf on our research paper.

In my fourth semester, I started working as a HiWi at the [Chair of Robotics, AI and Real-time Systems](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/air/home/) as an ML and Robotics Engineer. I contributed to the [Virtual Training Platform for Robot Learning](https://github.com/tum-i6/VTPRL) project and had the opportunity to frequently operate real robots in the lab, including the LBR iiwa manipulator.

Parallel to my studies, I also wanted to gain real-world experience at a company. I joined [DeepScenario](https://www.deepscenario.com/), where I learned how startups operate, focusing on fast problem-solving and business acumen. One of the most challenging tasks I faced was optimizing road networks' elevation profiles to fit accurately with natural ground contours, achieving an error tolerance of just 0.05 meters.

In October 2023, I began working on my M.Sc. thesis on Depth Prediction and SLAM under the supervision of S. Laina, S. Schaefer, and Prof. Dr. Stefan Leutenegger at the [Smart Robotics Lab](https://srl.cit.tum.de/). I chose this thesis strategically, knowing it would challenge me in areas where I had little experience, such as SLAM, optimization, and uncertainty estimation. The title is "Scale-Aware Landmark-based SLAM in Canonical Space," and we are currently working on publishing this research.

Through these experiences, I discovered my true passion for computer vision and, more specifically, state representation learning. This field fascinates me, as it involves creating robust latent embeddings or intermediate representations to solve complex tasks.

More is coming, and I am excited to see where this journey takes me next.
