### Introduction
Returning to Munich from Greece, I was eager to dive back into university life, explore volunteering opportunities, and meet new people. My search for a fitting student team led me to the "Women in Computer Science" (WiCS) club. What began as a chance to contribute soon turned into a profound learning experience about inclusivity, empathy, and personal growth.

### Joining the Team
I discovered the WiCS team and, after confirming that males were welcome, decided to attend their first recruiting event. As one of the few males there, I felt out of place at first. However, as the day progressed, I realized that my experience mirrored the challenges faced by many women in tech, who often find themselves as the minority in their classes and professional environments.

### The Coffee Meetup
At the Coffee Meetup, I began to feel more integrated into the team. My initial anxieties about being the only male faded as I engaged in discussions about the team's operations and the unique challenges faced by women in computer science. The warmth and support from my peers made me feel more at ease and highlighted the importance of understanding their experiences.

### Lessons on the Pay Gap
During our discussions, I learned that the gender pay gap extends beyond salaries. Women not only earn less but also often face a greater burden of domestic responsibilities. This disparity means they juggle more tasks at home while managing their professional commitments. Understanding these challenges has deepened my appreciation for the need for greater equity in both professional and personal spheres.

### The PhD Event
We hosted a PhD event where female students shared their doctoral journeys. Listening to their stories was incredibly inspiring. It was touching to hear that the speakers also benefited from this event by connecting with each other and reflecting on their experiences. Their reflections were not only valuable for the audience but also provided meaningful insights and encouragement for the speakers themselves. This mutual benefit underscored the power of sharing and support within our community.

### The Christmas Party
The Christmas party was a highlight of my time with WiCS. The event featured delicious food, a festive atmosphere, and thoughtful presents. One of the most emotional moments was the session where we discussed our resolutions from the previous year. A particular story stood out: one of the members shared how, despite working in a male-dominated company, she felt secure and supported by our group. She expressed that our student club provided a safe space where she could be herself, and this emotional moment emphasized the significance of having such supportive communities.

### Conclusion
My journey with the "Women in Computer Science" club was more than just an opportunity to contribute; it was a profound learning experience about inclusivity, empathy, and personal growth. Engaging with this diverse group has enriched my perspective and will undoubtedly influence my approach to teamwork and leadership in the future.
