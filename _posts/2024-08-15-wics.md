### Introduction
Returning to Munich from Greece, I was eager to dive back into university life, explore volunteering opportunities, and meet new people. My search for a fitting student team led me to the "Women in Computer Science" (WiCS) club. What began as a chance to contribute soon turned into a profound learning experience about inclusivity, empathy, and personal growth.

### Joining the Team
Upon discovering the WiCS team and confirming that males were welcome, I decided to attend their first recruiting event. Initially, I felt out of place as one of the few males present. However, as the day progressed, I began to see how my experience mirrored the challenges faced by many women in tech, who often find themselves as the minority in their classes and professional environments.

### The Coffee Meetup
My integration into the team became more seamless at the Coffee Meetup. My initial worries about being the only M.Sc. male faded as I engaged in discussions about the team's operations and the unique challenges faced by women in Computer Science. The warmth and support from my peers helped me feel at ease and highlighted the importance of understanding their experiences.

### Lessons on the Pay Gap
In line with our commitment to fostering dialogue on gender equality, our team organized a special event focusing on the gender pay gap. We invited experts who shared valuable insights into how the pay gap extends beyond salaries. They highlighted that women not only earn less but also carry a greater burden of domestic responsibilities, managing more tasks at home while balancing professional commitments. This deeper understanding has enhanced our appreciation for the need for greater equity in both professional and personal spheres.

### The PhD Event
We also hosted a PhD event where female students shared their doctoral journeys. Hearing their stories was incredibly inspiring. It was especially touching to learn that the speakers benefited from the event by connecting with one another and reflecting on their experiences. Their reflections provided meaningful insights and encouragement not only for the audience but also for the speakers themselves. This mutual benefit underscored the power of sharing and support within our community.

### The Christmas Party
The Christmas party was a highlight of my time with WiCS. The event featured delicious food, a festive atmosphere, and thoughtful presents. One of the most emotional moments occurred during a session where we revisited our resolutions from the previous year. A particularly poignant story was shared by a member who, despite not being actively present at the club, felt a profound sense of security and support from our group. She expressed that knowing our student club existed as a safe space gave her comfort, even when she wasn't physically present. This emotional moment underscored the significance of having such supportive communities and the lasting impact they can have.

### The School Girls Program
Another fulfilling experience was organizing the School Girls Program, where we invited girls aged 12 to 16 to our university. We arranged a series of lectures, interactive events about university life, and presentations highlighting our student team. The goal was to inspire and educate these young girls about opportunities in computer science and STEM fields. Seeing their excitement and receiving their positive feedback was incredibly gratifying. The program's impact was clear, and their enthusiasm reinforced the importance of encouraging future generations to explore these fields.

### Conclusion
My journey with the "Women in Computer Science" club was more than just an opportunity to contribute; it was a profound learning experience about inclusivity, empathy, and personal growth. Engaging with this diverse group has enriched my perspective and will undoubtedly influence my approach to teamwork and leadership in the future.
