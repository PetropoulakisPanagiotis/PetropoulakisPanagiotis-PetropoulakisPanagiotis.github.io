Computer Science student at the <a href="https://www.tum.de/en/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Technical University of Munich</a>. My passion lies in Computer Vision, and I am particularly interested in State Representation research. Specifically, I explore ways to enhance latent representations and embeddings by incorporating additional objective functions, such as masked reconstruction of specific object parts. My goal is to improve the robustness of the original task, including but not limited to RGB reconstruction.</p> <p>Our time is limited, and I choose to spend mine on four things I love: my passion for research, staying active and healthy through sports and nutritious food, connecting with family and friends, and volunteering. I am passionate about being involved in initiatives related to children interested in technology and women in tech.</p> <p>My goal through my research and projects is to connect with people, both to offer and to learn from them, and ideally, to leave a positive impact.</p> <p>For additional information, please visit my <a href="https://petropoulakispanagiotis.github.io/blog/">blog</a> and have a look at my <a href="https://petropoulakispanagiotis.github.io/cv/">CV</a>.</p> </body></html>
